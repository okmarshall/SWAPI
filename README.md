## SWAPI

### What has been done?

 - Able to retrieve a 'person' by ID or retrieve all people that the Star Wars API is aware of
 - Store the retrieved data in a local SQLite database using Entity Framework Core
 - Dependencies are resolved using .NET Core Dependency Injection
 - Settings can be read from appsettings.json
 - Tests added for the RequestManager, 'stubbing' the Star Wars API response with local files

### Next Steps

 - Implement other models (e.g. films, planets)
 - Retrieve the data for the other models from the API
 - Establish foregin key relationship between the models/tables
 - Extract the ID from each model to use as the database identity (currently auto-generated by EF Core)
 - Add exception logging e.g. Log4Net, .NET Core Logging
